# IoT Health Assistant

The IoT Health Assistant is an ESP32-based project that monitors vital health parameters, including heart rate, blood oxygen level (SpO2), temperature, and humidity, and sends the data to the Blynk IoT platform for real-time visualization.

## Features
- **Heart Rate & SpO2 Monitoring**: Uses the MAX30105 sensor to measure heart rate (bpm) and blood oxygen saturation (%).
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Measures temperature using DS18B20 (in Â°F) and DHT11 (in Â°C) sensors.
- **Humidity Monitoring**: Measures humidity (%) using the DHT11 sensor.
- **Real-Time Data**: Sends sensor data to the Blynk app every 2 seconds.
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Utilizes the ESP32â€™s WiFi capabilities for cloud integration.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)
- MAX30105 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (with 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistor)
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Jumper wires, breadboard, and power supply (3.3V or 5V)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (version 2.x recommended)
- Blynk App (iOS or Android) for data visualization
- Arduino libraries:
  - `Wire.h` (built-in)
  - `MAX30105.h` by SparkFun
  - `heartRate.h` by SparkFun
  - `spo2_algorithm.h` by SparkFun
  - `OneWire.h` by Jim Studt
  - `DallasTemperature.h` by Miles Burton
  - `DHT.h` by Adafruit
  - `WiFi.h` (included with ESP32 board package)
  - `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h` by Volodymyr Shymanskyy

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Download from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add ESP32 board support: Follow [Espressifâ€™s guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).

2. **Install Libraries**:
   - Open Arduino IDE â†’ Sketch â†’ Include Library â†’ Manage Libraries.
   - Search and install:
     - `SparkFun MAX3010x Sensor Library`
     - `OneWire`
     - `DallasTemperature`
     - `DHT sensor library`
     - `Blynk`
   - Alternatively, download libraries from their respective GitHub repositories.

3. **Configure Blynk**:
   - Sign up at [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) and create a new device.
   - Use the provided `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID` and `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` in `secrets.h`.
   - Update `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` in `secrets.h` with your WiFi credentials.

4. **Upload Code**:
   - Open `IoT_Health_Assistant.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Place `secrets.h` in the same folder as the `.ino` file.
   - Select your ESP32 board and port in the IDE.
   - Upload the code.

5. **Set Up Blynk App**:
   - In the Blynk app, create a dashboard with widgets for:
     - `V1`: DS18B20 temperature (Â°F)
     - `V2`: DHT11 temperature (Â°C)
     - `V3`: DHT11 humidity (%)
     - `V4`: Heart rate (bpm)
     - `V5`: SpO2 (%)
   - Ensure the device is online in the app.

## Usage
- Power on the ESP32 and place your finger on the MAX30105 sensor to measure heart rate and SpO2.
- Sensor data is sent to Blynk every 2 seconds.
- Monitor real-time data in the Blynk app or Serial Monitor (115200 baud).

## Troubleshooting
- **MAX30105 not detected**: Check I2C wiring (SDA/SCL) and power supply. Ensure the sensor is compatible with 3.3V/5V.
- **No Blynk connection**: Verify WiFi credentials in `secrets.h` and ensure the Blynk server is accessible.
- **Invalid sensor readings**: Check sensor wiring and ensure libraries are correctly installed.
- **Serial Monitor issues**: Set baud rate to 115200 in the Arduino IDE.
